🧾 1. Audit Log / Change History
Goal: Track who made what change to employee data, when, and what the old vs new values were.

✅ What to Track:
User: Who made the change (e.g., admin@company.com)

Timestamp: When it was made

Action: CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE

Entity: What table/field (e.g., Employee, salary)

Old Value → New Value

🔧 Implementation Plan:
➤ Backend Approach (Node.js or Django):
Middleware/Hook Layer

Intercept every data modification request.

Compare existing values vs. incoming values.

Store in an audit_logs table

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "user": "admin@company.com",
  "action": "UPDATE",
  "entity": "Employee",
  "record_id": "EMP123",
  "field": "salary",
  "old_value": 50000,
  "new_value": 55000,
  "timestamp": "2025-06-17T10:30Z"
}
Frontend Viewer

Show changelog per employee or globally

Allow filtering (by user, action, field)

🧰 Tools:
Node.js + Express: Use middleware + Mongo/PostgreSQL

Django: Use Django signals (post_save, pre_save)

Optional: Redis or Kafka for real-time logging

Frontend: React table with filters & search

🧠 Bonus Learning:
Data integrity

Middleware/event-based architecture

Optional: versioning (roll back changes!)

📄 2. Resume Upload & Parsing
Goal: Let users upload a resume and extract structured data (name, email, skills, experience, etc.)

✅ Fields to Extract:
Full Name

Email

Phone

Skills (hard/soft)

Education

Work Experience (company, years)

Summary or Objective (optional)

🔧 Implementation Options:
➤ Python (Recommended) with NLP:
Frontend:

Upload PDF/Docx

Send to backend

Backend (Python + Flask or FastAPI):

Extract text:

Use pdfminer or PyMuPDF (for PDFs)

Use python-docx for DOCX

Parse entities:

Use spaCy or custom regex

Use pre-trained models like en_core_web_sm

Return structured JSON:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@gmail.com",
  "skills": ["Python", "Machine Learning", "SQL"],
  "experience": ["Google - 2 years", "Amazon - 1 year"]
}
🧰 Tools & Libraries:
Text extraction:

PDFs: pdfminer.six, PyMuPDF

DOCX: python-docx

NLP:

spaCy (NLP pipeline)

re (regex for fallback)

Frontend (optional):

React upload form with drag/drop

🤖 Bonus:
Add resume preview

Store uploaded CVs in cloud (AWS S3, Firebase)

Match candidate to job using keyword matching

🚀 Project Idea:
Build a “Smart HR Panel” combining both:

Feature	Description
📝 Upload Resume	Extract and auto-fill employee profile
🕵️ Change Log	Track who changed which field in that profile
🔍 Searchable Audit	Admin panel to trace all edits by employee/user/date
